"""
Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.
If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.

Thoughts:
Using difference of node counts
Get count of the nodes in the first list, let count be c1.
Get count of the nodes in the second list, let count be c2.
Get the difference of counts d = abs(c1 â€“ c2)
Traverse the bigger list from the first node till d nodes so that from here onwards both the lists have equal no of nodes.
Traverse both the lists in parallel till we come across a common node.
(Note that getting a common node is done by comparing the address of the nodes)
