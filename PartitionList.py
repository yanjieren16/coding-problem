Given a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.
You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

Example:
Input: head = 1->4->3->2->5->2, x = 3
Output: 1->2->2->4->3->5

Initialize first and last nodes of below three linked lists as NULL.
Linked list of values smaller than x.
Linked list of values equal to x.
Linked list of values greater than x.
Iterate through the original linked list.
If a nodeâ€™s value is less than x then append it at the end of smaller list.
If the value is equal to x, then at the end of equal list.
And if value is greater, then at the end of greater list.
Concatenate three lists
Needs extra space
